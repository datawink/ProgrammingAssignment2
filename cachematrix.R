## This pair of functions work together to enable the caching of the calculating of the inverst of a matrix.
## First makeCacheMatrix creates a special type of matrix which caches it's inverse.  cacheSolve can be run to check if the inverse
## calculation has already been cached.  If so, it returns the cached inverse.  If not, it calculates the inverse and updates the
## cached inverse in the special makeCacheMatrix matrix  

## 
## Attributions:  These two functions represent just minor modifcations of the makeVector and cachemean functions created by R. Peng 
##                for the Coursera Programming in R Course
##                The coding of this assignment was made possilbe thanks to the excellend explanation of the makeVector and cachemean 
##                functions posted by Leonard Greski on the disucssion board for this assignment

## Write a short comment describing this function

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Write a short comment describing this function

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
